# <Prework-Studyguide>

## Description

I created this study guide as pre-work for the Coding Bootcamp through the University of Washington. This allowed me to familiarize myself with some coding languages and prepare myself for the course. The notes I have taken, which I'm sure I will add onto later, will help me to succeed moving forward. Learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git/Gitbash and Github is something that will serve me well.

## Usage

Using this study guide is quite simple. Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows) opens Chrome DevTools where a console panel will appear in the browser. The topics/languages learned in the prework will show up and a suggestion will be given on which to study. Using this regularly will help material retention and should be done at least twice a week if not more.
