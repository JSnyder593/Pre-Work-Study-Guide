      <h2>Git</h2>
      <h3>Git Basics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that allows you to manage and keep track of each version of your project</li>
          <li>Git is accessed through the command line</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Our projects are done through GitHub; a cloud-based hosting service that we keep track of projects inside repositories that are stored remotely</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Setup</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git config --global user.name "[firstname lastname]" ; set a name that is indentifiable for cred when reviewing version history</li>
          <li>git config --global user.email "[valid-email]" ; set a name that will be associated with each history marker</li>
          <li>git config --global color.ui auto ; set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Setup & Init</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git init ; initialize an existing directory as a Git repository</li>
          <li>git clone [url] ; retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Stage & Snapshot</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git status ; show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit</li>
          <li>git add [file] ; add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)</li>
          <li>git reset [file] ; unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory</li>
          <li>git diff ; diff of what is changed but not staged</li>
          <li>git diff --staged ; diff of what is staged but not yet committed</li>
          <li>git commit -m "[descriptive message]" ; commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Branch & Merge</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git branch ; list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch</li>
          <li>git branch [branch-name] ; create a new branch at the current commit</li>
          <li>git checkout ; switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory</li>
          <li>git merge [branch] ; merge the specified branch's history into the current one</li>
          <li>git log ; show all commits in the current branch's history</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Inspect & Compare</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git log ; show the commit history for the currently active branch</li>
          <li>git log branchB..branchA ; show the commits that changed file, even across renames</li>
          <li>git show [SHA] ; show any object in Git in human-readable format</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Tracking Path Changes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git rm [file] ; delete the file from project and stage the removal for commit</li>
          <li>git mv [existing-path] [new-path] ; change an existing file path and stage the move</li>
          <li>git log --stat -M ; show all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Ignoring Patterns</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>logs/
            *.notes
            pattern*/
          (save a file with desired patterns as .gitignore with either direct string matches or wildcard globs)</li>
          <li> git config --global core.excludesfile [file] ; system wide ignore pattern for all local repositories</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Share & Update</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git remote add [alias] [url] ; add a git URL as an alias</li>
          <li>git fetch [alias] ; fetch down all the branches from that Git remote</li>
          <li>git merge [alias]/[branch] merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date</li>
          <li>git push [alias] [branch] ; transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch</li>
          <li>git pull ; fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Rewrite History</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git rebase [branch] ; apply any commits of current branch ahead of specified one</li>
          <li>git reset --hard [commit] ; clear staging area, rewrite working tree from specified commit</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Temporary Commits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git stash ; save modified and staged changes</li>
          <li>git stash list ; list stack-order of stashed file changes</li>
          <li>git stash pop ; write working from top of stash stack</li>
          <li>git stash drop ; discard the changes from top of stash stack</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li> An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal. </li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the starting point for our loop, the condition and the final statement</li>
          <li>x++ = x+1</li>
          <li>a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
